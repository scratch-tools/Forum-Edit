# Forum Edit

Forum Edit is an API proxy for editing posts on the Scratch Discussion Forums.

## To do
- Upgrade to ES6 modules instead of CJS
- Add user login cache system for efficiency (questionable on basis of security)

## Setup

To set up Forum Edit, clone this repository and run `npm install` and `npm start`. Note that this must be hosted in order to be used, and Repl.it hosting does not work due to a Scratch IP ban on Repl.it.
